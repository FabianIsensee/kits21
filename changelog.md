# Changelog

This file is meant to keep track of which annotations were changed in each dataset version. Broadly, the *major* version will be incremented with any change to the postprocessing code that causes every region to be regenerated (starting at `v1.x.x`). The *minor* version will be incremented with the addition of new **imaging**, and the *patch* version will be incremented with new **annotations** for the existing imaging.
