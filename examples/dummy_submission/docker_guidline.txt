Step 1. Install Docker
To install docker use following instructions https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ depending on your OS.

Step 2. Creating Dockerfile
A good practice when using docker is to create a dockerfile with all needed requirements and needed operations. One can find an example of the docker file here in the dummy_submission folder. Please make sure this file is placed to the same folder as your python script to run inference on the test data INFERENCE_SCRIPT.py file and directory MODEL/ that contains your training weights.

Step 3. Build a docker image from a dockerfile.
Navigate to the directory with the dockerfile and run following command:

docker build -t YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME .

Step 4. Run a container from a created docker image.
A container is a process which runs on a host. To run this process "docker run" command has to be executed with specifying docker image to derive the container from. For this, one needs to run the following:

nvidia-docker run --rm -it --runtime=nvidia -v LOCAL_PATH:/home --name YOUR_DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME

-v flag mounts the directories between your local host and the container.

Step 5. Running inference script within the container
To run the script, one should execute:

python inference_script.py

Spet 6. Save running container
To import or save running container to test_container.tar file on your local machine, one should run:

docker save -o test_container.tar YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME

(Optional)
Step 7. To double check your saved container, one can load it with running:

docker load -i test_container.tar

and run it again with command:

sudo docker run --rm -it -v LOCAL_PATH:/home --name YOUR_DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME
