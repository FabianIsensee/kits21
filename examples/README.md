### Model baseline and Submission examples

In this foldere we provide instructions for how to train a baseline model (nnUNet) as well as how to submit your 
algorithm using docker containers.

- `nnUNet_baseline` contains instructions on how to train nnUNet. Note that this is merely intended as inspiration. We 
  by no means require participants to use nnUnet! However, we strongly encourage participants to compare their model's
  performance to the performance achieved by the nnUNet baseline.
  
- `submission` contains guidelines for successful submission of your trained model to the test set. We 
  have prepared examples for creating the needed docker containers.
