### Model baseline and Submission examples

Here we give an instructions for training a baseline model (nnUNet) and an examples for docker submission.

- Folder /nnUNet_baseline has instructions of how to train nnUNet. Note that this is merely intended as inspiration. We 
  by no means require participants to use nnUnet! However, we strongly encourage the participants to compare their model
  performance to the performance achieved by the nnUNet baseline.
  
- Folder /submission has guidelines for successful submission of your trained model to the test set. We have prepared 
  examples for creating the needed docker containers and provide guidelines for docker installation.
