# Examples

This folder contains instructions for training a baseline nnUNet model, and examples for making official docker submissions.

- Folder `/submission` has guidelines for successful submission of your trained model as well as example code for building these Docker containers

- Folder `/nnUNet_baseline` has instructions of how to train nnUNet for this challenge.
  - This is merely intended as inspiration. **We by no means require participants to use nnUnet!** However, we encourage participants to compare their model performance to the performance achieved by the nnUNet baseline, and participants are welcome to extend this implementation if they so desire
