# Examples

This folder contains instructions for training a baseline nnUNet model, and examples for making official docker submissions.

- `nnUNet_baseline` contains instructions on how to train nnUNet. This is merely intended as inspiration.
  **We by no means require participants to use nnUnet!** However, we encourage participants to compare their model 
  performance to the performance achieved by the nnUNet baseline, and participants are welcome to extend this 
  implementation if they so desire

- `submission` contains guidelines for successful submission of your trained model to the test set. We 
  have prepared examples for creating the needed docker containers.
