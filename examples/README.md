### Model baseline and submission examples

Here we give an example for developing a baseline model (nnUNet) as well as examples for docker submission.

- Folder /nnUNet_baseline has instructions of how to train nnUNet model. By no means we restrict participants to use
  nnUnet as a start point for developing a model. However, we strongly encourage the participants to compare their model
  performance to the performance of nnUNet baseline.
  
- Folder /submission has guidelines for successful submission of your model. We have prepared examples of docker
  submissions as well as short set of guidelines for docker installation and main docker commands needed for the 
  submission.
